#OS-Detection-Script

##What does it do?
  It finds the data about the computer and displays it. The data is information on the operating system and the hardware.

###Please note that this isn't anywhere near complete due to the variety of computer systems out there.

##How to get this script:

  Download the zip file from https://codeload.github.com/ThatFurryOne/OS-Detection-Script/zip/master via a browser or wget:

  ```
  wget https://codeload.github.com/ThatFurryOne/OS-Detection-Script/zip/master
  unzip OS-Detection-Script-master.zip
  cd OS-Detection-Script-master/
  ```
  
  Or use git clone:
  
  ``` 
  git clone https://github.com/ThatFurryOne/OS-Detection-Script.git
  cd OS-Detection-Script-master/
  ```

##Running the script?
  This should suffice once you are in the same directory as the script.
  ```
  ./detect.sh
  ```
  
  However permissions on some of the files that it gets the data from may prevent it from running correctly so you may need to run with sudo.
  ```
  sudo ./detect.sh
  ```
